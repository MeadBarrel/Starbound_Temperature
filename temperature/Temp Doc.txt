Temperature API
===============
This documentation is here to help you quickly integrate the system into your mod.
Though most of the system is JSON friendly either directly or indirectly. Certain parts are not - this was done intentionally to allow uniformity.
The main part of the system which is not JSON friendly is the main side effects which occur at what temperatures. Though you can "Add" to those side effects through status effects. This is to allow maximum compatibility with other mods. After all if everyone changes these values it will just result in a mess. 

The players side effects progressively worsens as the players temperature increases or decreases. 

PLAYER_PRIMARY UNIQUE VARIABLES
======
playerDied - checks if player has died and resets on revive to false.

STAT's
======
maxTemperature - maximum temperature of player
rateTemperature - This modifies the change to temperature with this factor. [advanced users only - default off ]
armorColdMax - Protection from cold - should be positive number (unless you want person to loose heat faster ) - place these values in stats in armor
armorHeatMax - Protection from heat - should be negative number (unless you want person to heat up faster) - - place these values in stats in armor
armorColdRate - Gradual rate of heat given by armor ( should be positive number ) - default 0 - Do not keep in armor - use Lua to modify -- not required
armorHeatRate - Gradual rate of cooling given by armor ( should be negative number ) - default 0 - Do not keep in armor - use Lua to modify -- not required

RESOURCES
=======
temperature - current temperature of player
armorHeat - current heat protection of player
armorCold - current cold protection of player

BIOME LUA / (JSON) VARIABLES
========
biomeTemp - the temperature of the biome (calculated using math.random of bioTempLow and bioTempHigh)
bioLow / (biomeTempLow) - lowest possible temperature of Biome 
bioHigh / (biomeTempHigh)- highest possible temperature of Biome
biomeTempRate / (biomeTempRatePerSec)- the rate at which the players temperature is modified.

WORLD VARIABLES (world.getProperty())
========
temperature - the temperature of the world accessible by objects

STATUS EFFECTS
========
TEMPERATURE_MODIFIER / (JSON) - Description
self.temperatureRateMod / ( rateModifier ) = rate at which temperature changes (negative for cold, positive for heat )
self.temperatureMod / ( tempModifier ) = the amount of points to be added to temperature ( negative for cold, positive for heat )
effect.duration() / (duration) = the period of time the amount is given




Default Values
=============
maxTemperature = 6000 
Player normal temperature range = 1500 - 4500 ( 3000 units )

Recommended Values
=============
Biome Type = Rate of Decrease ( Time to reach max points from midpoint )
Cool Planets = -2 ( 25 minutes )
Tundra Planets = -5 ( 10 minutes )
Snow Planets = -10 ( 5 minutes ) 
Arctic Planets = -15 ( 3.3 minutes ) 
Moon = -33.33 ( 90 seconds ) 
Arctic Ocean = -50 ( 60 seconds )
Warm = 2 ( 25 minutes )
Desert = 5 ( 10 minutes )
Ocean Floor = 5 ( 10 minutes )
Volcanic = 10 ( 3.3 minutes )
Magma = 33.33 ( 90 seconds)

It is strongly advised you trade off protection for environmental defence for sake of balance. 

MISC STATS
=======
-- For the following -- Understanding Calculation
-- Resistance is applied prior to calculation. So 30 damage over 30 seconds. a +1 resistance would be 29 damage over 30 seconds.
armorPoisonMax = Positive number blocks Poison damage. Negative adds exponentially to poison damage
armorAcidMax = Positive number blocks acid damage. Negative adds exponentially to acid damage
armorFireMax = Positive number blocks fire damage. Negative adds exponentially to fire damage

KNOWN ISSUES
=======
One problem is these indicators will not show on your character screen. It is recommended you add it in descriptions. 
As far as I am aware you cannot modify the character screen yet. Though the image asset ui.png is found in the interface folder.
