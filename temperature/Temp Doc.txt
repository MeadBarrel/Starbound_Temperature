#TEMPERATURE API

The temperature API is essentially a framework to allow modders to create a better survival experience. Though it can be used as is - though  it will take more time to integrate properly with vanilla as the constant change in progression mechanics does make things difficult. For modders who wish instead create their own entire survival mod or integrate temperature some how with something else. This makes it possible.

If you wish to edit the framework it is recommended you add the line  
"requires" : "temperature"  
into your modinfo file. This will allow cross compatibility with other mods instead of direct integration which can arise in conflicts.

###PLAYER.CONFIG CHANGES
####STATS
*maxTemperature - maximum temperature the player has
*rateTemperature - the delta rate modifier everytime temperature is calculated
*enviroTemperature - an experimental calculation which lets you modify temperature based on the type of enviroment ( inside building \ underground \ etc )
*armorColdMax - temperature modifier given by armor which is applied anytime cold effect is applied ( positive for resistance, negative for weakness )
*armorHeatMax - temperature modifier given by armor which is applied anytime heat effect is applied ( positive for resisitance, negative for weaknss )
*armorColdRate - do not use
*armorHeatRate - do not use


####RESOURCES
*temperature - current temperature of the player
*armorCold - modifiable protection value of cold temperature
*armorHeat - modifiable protection value of heat temperature

Armor Cold \ Heat resources lets you have something modify the effectiveness of the worn armor. 

####SCRIPT
*temperature.lua is the primary script dealing with player side effects of temperature

###BIOME
#####biomeTemperature.lua
is the primary biome modifier file. This is a generic template to use. You are free to create a lua file for different planets. Just maintain the same naming convention when dealing with vanilla files! this is to allow compatibility with other mods. Though you should maintain the same modifier names. 

####LUA \ JSON Calls.
*biomeNight \ biomeTempNight - The extreme night time temperature value. Default colder than morning. 
*biomeDay \ biomeTempDay - The extreme day time temperature value. Default warmer than night.
*biomeTempRate \ biomeTempRatePer10Sec - The rate of temperature change of the planet every 10 seconds
